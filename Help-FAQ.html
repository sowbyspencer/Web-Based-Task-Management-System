                <h3>How the Program Works</h3>
                <p>The Task Management System is designed for easy task tracking. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks with ease. A search feature allows for quick location of specific tasks. The system's design ensures that tasks remain accessible upon subsequent visits when using the same device and browser.</p>

                <h3>Understanding the Backend Logic</h3>
                <p>When you add or modify a task, the changes are immediately saved to the browser's local storage. This ensures that no data is lost even if you close the browser or refresh the page. The application retrieves these tasks from local storage every time it is loaded, ensuring continuity of your task list.</p>
                <p>As the system is client-side only, it does not require server-side processing or external databases. This makes it lightweight and quick to respond, but also means that your tasks are only accessible from the browser where they were created.</p>
