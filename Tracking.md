### Revised Project: Web-Based Task Management System

This application will run in a web browser and include:

1. **Task Management Features**: Add, view, and mark tasks as complete using a simple web interface.
2. **TypeScript for Logic**: Implement the task management logic in TypeScript.
3. **HTML/CSS for UI**: Use HTML for the structure and CSS for styling the web interface.
4. **Local Storage**: Store tasks in the browser's local storage to avoid database complexity.

### Project Structure

```scss
Task Management System/
|-- node_modules/       // Folder containing all the npm packages installed
|-- package-lock.json   // File to lock down the versions of installed npm packages
|-- package.json        // Defines the project dependencies and other metadata
|-- README.md           // Markdown file containing an overview of your project,
|-- Tracking.md         // A Markdown file for tracking progress, notes, etc
|-- tsconfig.json       // Configuration file for TypeScript
|-- src/                // Source folder containing all the code for your project
    |-- app.ts          // Main TypeScript file where the application logic resides
    |-- index.html      // The main HTML file for your web application
    |-- styles.css      // CSS file for styling the HTML
```

### Initial Estimated Time Breakdown

- Day 1: Set up the project, TypeScript configuration, and basic HTML structure.
- Day 2-3: Design the UI with CSS and start implementing basic TypeScript logic.
- Day 4: Develop task management features (add, view tasks) in TypeScript.
- Day 5: Implement task completion and local storage integration.
- Day 6: Testing, debugging, and refining the application.


### Project Overview: Structure/Design/Architecture

#### 1. Frontend (User Interface)

- **HTML** (`index.html`): The basic structure of the web application, containing elements for task input, a task display area, and possibly controls for task manipulation (like add, delete).
- **CSS** (`styles.css`): Stylesheet to make the UI user-friendly and visually appealing.

#### 2. TypeScript Components

- **Task Class** (`Task.ts`): Represents a task, including properties like title, description, completion status, and an array of subtasks.
- **TaskManager Class** (`TaskManager.ts`): Manages tasks, including adding new tasks, handling subtasks, and traversing the task list (potentially using recursion).
- **Main App Logic** (`app.ts`): Connects the UI with the TypeScript logic. It handles user interactions, updates the UI, and manages the overall application state.

#### 3. Data Handling

- **Local Storage**: To persist tasks between sessions without a backend, using the browser's local storage.

#### 4. Additional Concepts

- **Recursion**: Used in `TaskManager` for handling nested subtasks, such as displaying them in a structured format.
- **Asynchronous Functions**: Potentially used for simulating data fetching/storing operations, enhancing the UX with asynchronous processing.

### Revised SCRUM-like Sprint Schedule

**Duration**: 1 Week (5 Sessions)

#### Session 1: Project Setup and Task Class (2-4 hours)

- Setup project structure and review existing setup (HTML, CSS, TypeScript).
- Implement the `Task` class with subtasks support.

#### Session 2: TaskManager Class and Basic UI Setup (2-4 hours)

- Develop the `TaskManager` class with methods for task handling.
- Basic frontend integration to add and display tasks.

#### Session 3: Recursive Function and Advanced Task Handling (2-4 hours)

- Implement a recursive function for nested task display.
- Enhance the `TaskManager` class to handle nested tasks.

#### Session 4: UI Integration and Styling (2-4 hours)

- Further integrate TypeScript classes with the frontend.
- Improve UI with CSS for better usability and appearance.

#### Session 5: Finalization and Testing (2-4 hours)

- Implement any remaining functionality (like task completion, deletion).
- Thorough testing and debugging.
- Documentation and code commenting.

### Daily Progress Check-ins

- Brief self-review to assess progress and adjust the plan for the next session.

### End-of-Week Review

- Review the completed work, functionality, and UI.
- Reflect on the process and identify any areas for improvement.

# Recording section
- Created a new directory and initialize a simple web project.
- Set up `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.ts` in the `src` folder.
- Added the `tsconfig.json` file.
- Installed Node.js and TypeScript
- Project specific files/packages installed.
